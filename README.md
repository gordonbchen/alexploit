A program to deny Alex's access to PowerSchool. ðŸ™ƒ
* Uses selenium to fill and submit forms
* run `py main.py -u (replace_with_username) -i (replace_with_iterations)`
* Change PowerSchool login page if different school system
* Bug with buffering behavior after form submission. Let me know if you fix this!
